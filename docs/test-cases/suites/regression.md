# Regression Suite

[← Test case index](../README.md)

Regression = every non-obsolete test case, in three tiers. Pick the tier by how much changed.

| Tier | Content | When to run | Test cases |
|---|---|---|---|
| **R1 — Critical** | All ★ critical + all P1 | Every merge to main / nightly | 225 |
| **R2 — Core** | R1 + all P2 | Before each release candidate | 528 |
| **R3 — Full** | Everything (incl. P3 field / UI validation) + all data variants | Before production release / major refactor | 599 cases (1539 incl. variants) |

Data-driven cases run **all their variants** in regression; see the *Data variants* table under each case.

Cases with status **Review** stay in the suite but are tagged; a failure there must first be checked against the open question in [source-issues.md](../source-issues.md).

## Manual-only cases (9)

These stay in the manual regression checklist. Everything else is planned for automation.

## Automation layer split

| Layer | Cases | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Auto-UI | 305 | Browser test; assert on screen |
| Auto-UI+API | 235 | Act in UI (or API), assert numbers via API / parsed PDF |
| Auto-API | 50 | Pure API test (incl. parallel calls for concurrency) |
| Manual | 9 | Not automated (see list above) |
